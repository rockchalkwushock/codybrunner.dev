## Machine

I use the 27" 2020 Intel iMac [(Apple)](https://www.apple.com/imac-27/) baseline model with the processor spec bumped. I purchased [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MP3Y8QN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) RAM and upgraded the machine from 8GB to 40GB of RAM. Totally worth it! The 5k Retina display is amazing and other than being really pissed off that Apple is going to no longer do feature upgrades for Intel machines thanks to the new proprietary silicon processors I am really happy and will be using this for many years to come. Only down side is lack of mobility and if the power goes out I am shit out of luck.

## Monitor

I am using a 32" Dell Curved 4K UHD Monitor [(Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08G8WMRRP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) as my second monitor and I love it! I also use a monitor arm [(Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0833RF639/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to give me more space on my desk. Makes the setup look very nice and the arm was pretty easy to work with.

## Chair and Desk

When the pandemic hit and we all went remote I was still living in Portland and went from a standing desk and fairly nice office chair to a tiny stationary desk and card table chair. Needless-to-say my body suffered. I didn't want to purchase a nice setup since the plan was to move to Colombia at some point so I just made due. After moving to Colombia we moved two times before we got settled in to our home. More stationary desks and card table chairs üò≠ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è When I finally got around to getting my chair and desk I did a lot of research and took to Twitter to see what other developers were using. I settled on this combo from [Autonomous AI](https://www.autonomous.ai/) it was not cheap to get it here to Colombia, but my body thanks me daily! The desk is very quiet when transitioning and the chair is super comfortable.

## Storage

The iMac only has 500GB of storage which is honestly more than enough for what I do. I purchased a Samsung T5 SSD and it's been perfect for backups. [(Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073H552FJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

## Sound

I have two sets of headphones. I purchased some over-the-ear Sennheiser headphones [(Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSZSL4I/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) about 4 years ago and honestly they are amazing. I am sad they are starting to fall apart, but they have gotten the job done for a long time. I also have a pair of AirPods Pros [(Apple)](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/) that have amazing active noise cancelling and sound for how tiny they are. My complaint is how fragile they are. I dropped the left bud one time, from my ear to the desktop (maybe 20cm?) and they have never been the same. About every 3-4 weeks I have to go in to get them fixed. I get a buzzing/vibration noise when talking, humming, singing. The problem has actually ping ponged back and forth between both buds since I dropped the left one. It's very frustrating and with my warranty ending next month as soon as they get to wear I just can't stand using them anymore I'll be done with them and won't be buying another pair unless Apple seriously overhauls the durability of them.
