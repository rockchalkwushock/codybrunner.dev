It's been about two years now since the Yarn dev team released `yarn@2` otherwise known as `berry`. It was a significant change to the initial project and I remember the rumblings in Dev Twitter over the changes. I myself have never given `berry` a try mostly because I didn't want to deal with the cognitive load of changing a piece of tooling that was so crucial to my daily workflow. I was scrolling Twitter one night and came across this tweet from [@jaredpalmer](https://twitter.com/jaredpalmer) and snagged the link to check it out later (and by later I mean when I finally get bothered enough by the 90 opened tabs in Safari):

## What is pnpm?

`pnpm` is yet another package manager for the JavaScript ecosystem similar to `npm` & `yarn`. Where `pnpm` differs from the latter two is that:

`npm` and `yarn` both will create a new `node_modules` directory with fresh installs of the dependencies of your projects. So if you have 10 `react` projects on your machine there are 10 installs of `react` regardless of version on your machine as well. `pnpm` instead installs all dependencies in one location on your hard disk and hard links them to the `node_modules/.pnpm` in your projects. In this case there would only be one install of `react` (unless your projects utilize different version of the dependency) for all 10 projects. The `node_modules` for each project would reference back to the dependencies location on the hard disk.

## Installing

I use [homebrew](https://brew.sh) when I can for installing tooling and other software on my machine so when I was able to install `pnpm` via `homebrew` I was very happy. FYI the official documentation does not show this as an install method, however I did verify that it is not malicious:

```shell
brew search pnpm
brew info pnpm
  pnpm: stable 6.7.3 (bottled)
  üì¶üöÄ Fast, disk space efficient package manager

  build-error: 0 (30 days)
brew install pnpm
```

Everything after this is almost entirely identical to using `yarn`. You can look at the official [documentation](https://pnpm.io/motivation) for more information on commands.

You will also get `pnpx` installed globally which is the equivalent of `npx`.

`pnpm` even has support for workspaces, which I have not played with yet but plan on doing so in the future.

## Issues with the migration

First off I just removed `yarn` and all it's artifacts from my machine so every project broke. So needless-to-say that has been fun migrating over projects.

> "yarn" cannot be found ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Most of them have been as simple as:

```shell
rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock
pnpm -i

Packages: +1176
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Packages are hard linked from the content-addressable store to the virtual store.
Content-addressable store is at: /Users/codybrunner/.pnpm-store/v3
Virtual store is at:             node_modules/.pnpm
Progress: resolved 1175, reused 512, downloaded 663, added 1176, done

dependencies:

...

devDependencies:

...
```

However this was not the case for this website. I continuously received and error message about `esbuild` could not be found or that the versions were in conflict. I finally just branched off of staging and removed the majority of the source code, `node_modules`, and emptied the `package.json`. It turns out that the way `pnpm` installs packages the `esbuild` dependency of `mdx-bundler` is no longer at the top level where `mdx-bundler` expected it to be. Installing the correct version of `esbuild` as a dev dependency fixed the issue. There went 3 hours of my day ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

The next issue was my development pipeline. I use [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/), [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/), and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged). At first I just updated this to `pnpm run <script>` however I would get an error back saying `"<script> is not a script!"`. Makes sense because `commitlint` is not a script in my `package.json` it's a binary to be ran. So instead I needed to make use of `pnpx`. In the `.husky` directory I need to change the commands in the bash scripts to read like so:

```diff:.husky/commit-msg
- yarn run commitlint -e $1
+ pnpx commitlint -e $1
```

I ran into a similar `"<script> is not a script!"` issues with my CI/CD workflows on GitHub:

```diff:.github/workflows/feature.yml
    steps:
      - name: Linting
-       run: yarn run eslint
+       run: pnpx eslint

      - name: Type checking
-       run: yarn run tsc
+       run: pnpx tsc
```

Updating the steps to be ran in the CI/CD was actually not as painful as I imagined it would be. Even handling the caching in the container was pretty straightforward. Since I was already using the [setup-node](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-node-js-environment) action `npm` was present and one of the official ways to install `pnpm` is by running:

```shell
npm install -g pnpm
```

The [documentation](https://pnpm.io/continuous-integration#github-actions) on using `pnpm` with GitHub Actions on `pnpm`'s site says that you must run this command with root level permissions though so I needed to add a `sudo` to the front of that in my yaml file.

```diff:.github/workflows/feature.yml
steps:
  ...
- - name Get Yarn Cache
-   id: yarn-cache
-   run: echo "::set-output name=dir::$(yarn cache dir)"

  - name: Install Node
    uses: actions/setup-node@v2
    with:
      node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}

- - name: Cache Dependencies
+ - name: Cache .pnpm-store
+   uses: actions/cache@v2.1.5
+   id: pnpm-cache
    with:
-     path: ${{ steps.yarn-cache.outputs.dir }}
-     key: ${{ runner.os }}-yarn-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}
+     path: ~/.pnpm-store
+     key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ matrix.node-version }}-${{ hashFiles('**/pnpm-lock.yaml') }}
      restore-keys: |
-       ${{ runner.os }}-yarn-
+       ${{ runner.os }}-node-

+ - name: Install pnpm
+   run: sudo npm install -g pnpm

  - name: Install Dependencies
-   if: steps.yarn-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
-   run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
+   if: steps.pnpm-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
+   run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

The last problem I encountered was deploying to Vercel. At the time of writing Vercel does not support `pnpm` as a package manager option so when Vercel goes to install dependencies and build your project for deployment the deployment will fail **IF** you have the following in your `package.json` like I did:

```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "npx only-allow pnpm"
  }
}
```

I opened a discussion on adding support for `pnpm` to Vercel [here](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/discussions/6342).

## Aliasing

The last thing I did was to map the `pnpm` commands to the aliases I had in my `.zshrc` for `yarn`. I really did not want to deal with completely new aliases hence the mapping of the commands.

```shell
# Yarn related aliases
# These have been updated to alias the use of pnpm NOT Yarn
# and to not mess with my own mental modal I am keeping the
# aliases the same where they can be

alias ya="pnpm add";
alias yb="pnpm run build";
alias yc="pnpm run commit";
alias yd="pnpm run dev";
alias yga="pnpm add -g";
alias ygl="pnpm ls -g";
alias ygr="pnpm rm -g";
alias ygu="pnpm up -g -i";
alias yi="pnpm i"
alias yl="pnpm run lint";
alias yr="pnpm rm";
alias ys="pnpm start";
alias yt="pnpm t";
alias ytc="pnpm run type-check";
alias yu="pnpm up -i";
```
