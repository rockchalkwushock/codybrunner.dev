title: Fourth And Goal

For my international readers the title of this post will mean absolutely nothing to you. "Fourth and Goal" is an American footbal 🏈 term meaning the offense has one last try to score and the position in which they are on the field their are no more chances for getting another first down (inside the 10 yard line from the endzone). That's where we are at in 2021 which is freaking crazy that this year has flown by so fast. 2020, and I'm sure I am not alone in this, felt like a few decades went by!

## The Journey Thus Far 🤡

All the way back on January 1 I wrote [this post](https://codybrunner.dev/blog/2021/looking-at-2021-with-2020-vision) with a list of goals. I have pretty much shit the bed on everything. 🤦🏻‍♂️ This year has been a shit show. 💩 I lost my job and was unemployed for roughly 7 months. You would think that would leave me with plenty of time to do the things...hahahaha!!! 😂😂😂 The first 2.5 months was a mad dash to get a visa here in Colombia. Unfortunately I will have to go through that process again next year, but now I know what to expect so it should not be as bad. I also work and pay taxes here now so hopefully instead of the one year visa they will give me the three year visa I should have received to being with! We also moved twice which was a time suck and a hit to the ole billitera (wallet). On that note my Spanish is only slightly better. I know like 4 more ways to insult someone.😂 With all my wife and I have been through this year (shit still pending) we have not even thought about a wedding. We literally will be married for a year next month. That in and of itself is unbelievable to me. All that being said I can say I have managed to do a few things:

- My Elixir/Phoenix skills have improved although I need build more.
- I have read two books [Designing Elixir Systems with OTP](https://pragprog.com/titles/jgotp/designing-elixir-systems-with-otp/) and [Programming Ecto](https://pragprog.com/titles/wmecto/programming-ecto/) and I highly recommend both if you are wanting to get into Elixir/Phoenix development.
- My PostgreSQL skills have improved dramatically and to be honest I have learned so much about just how powerful it is.
- This is currently post number 15 so I am close to hitting my goal of 20 posts for the year.
- I don't workout at all, I eat dope ass food, and someone am not like 182 kgs (400 lbs) so that is something right? 😂 I think I have hovered around 84 kgs (185 lbs) for the last several months.
- I actually have started working with RaspberryPi and it's so much fun. I just have to find more time.
- I am employed again so that's always a good thing. I work as a Senior Developer for a company here in Colombia called [Lean Tech](https://www.leangroup.com/solutions/leantech).
