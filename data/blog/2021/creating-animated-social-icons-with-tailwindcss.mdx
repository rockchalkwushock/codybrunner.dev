title: Creating Animated Social Icons With TailwindCSS
---

import { Giphy, Signature } from '../components/MDXComponents.tsx'

One thing I will adamantly tell people is I am not a designer or UI/UX developer. I can barely dress myself in a fashionable sense (this was solved by marrying a Colombian woman ü§£üòè) so what makes you think I can give you anything but a website from 1993. Lately I have been working a lot with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and I honestly cannot recommend it enough. In my 2.5 years at Appointlet I significantly upped my CSS skills which was something I desperately needed. I wanted to start trying to spice up aspects of my website and did some reading and looking at examples of how to use animations and transitions in Tailwind. The result can be seen in the GIF below as well as on this site.

## Setting up the icons

You can see on my site I show off to visitors my GitHub, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter. I do that using the icons from [feather icons](https://feathericons.com/). To consolidate the lengthy `className` declarations that can come with using Tailwind I created a custom component that contains those styles (you can see that in the sass file below):

```tsx:components/SocialIcons.tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { GitHub, Instagram, Linkedin, Twitter } from 'react-feather'

import { constants } from '@utils/constants'

export const SocialIcons: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <li className="social-button">
        <a
          aria-label="Link to Cody Brunner's Github"
          href={constants.externalLinks.github}
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
        >
          <GitHub />
        </a>
      </li>
      <li className="social-button">
        <a
          aria-label="Link to Cody Brunner's Instagram"
          href={constants.externalLinks.instagram}
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
        >
          <Instagram />
        </a>
      </li>
      <li className="social-button">
        <a
          aria-label="Link to Cody Brunner's LinkedIn"
          href={constants.externalLinks.linkedin}
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
        >
          <Linkedin />
        </a>
      </li>
      <li className="social-button">
        <a
          aria-label="Link to Cody Brunner's Twitter"
          href={constants.externalLinks.twitter}
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
        >
          <Twitter />
        </a>
      </li>
    </>
  )
}
```

```scss:styles/global.scss
@import 'tailwindcss/base';
@import 'tailwindcss/components';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';

@layer components {
  .social-button {
    @apply bg-transparent duration-100 ease-in-out rounded-full text-accent transition-all hover:p-2 hover:text-white;
    a > svg {
      @apply h-8 w-8;
    }
  }
}

@layer utilities {
  .text-accent {
    @apply text-fuchsia-900 dark:text-teal-200;
  }
}
```

## Extending Tailwind: Custom Colors & Gradients

The first thing I wanted to do was make these icons use the branding colors of their respective service. This was pretty simple for GitHub, LinkedIn, & Twitter; however Instagram is not just one color, it uses a gradient. Some quick searching online lead me to this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/thomasrye/pen/VaRoYv) . Tailwind supports gradients so what I could do was add the gradient effect I found to the `backgroundImage` key.

- [Tailwind Gradient Colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/gradient-color-stops#customizing)

```diff:tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
+     backgroundImage: {
+       // bg-instagram || text-instagram
+       instagram: 'radial-gradient(circle at 30% 107%, #fdf497 0%,#fdf497 5%,#fd5949 45%,#d6249f 60%,+#285aeb 90%)'
+     },
      colors: {
        current: 'currentColor',
        transparent: 'transparent',
+       // bg-linkedIn || text-linkedIn
+       linkedIn: '#0072B1',
+       // bg-twitter || text-twitter
+       twitter: '#1DA1F2',
        ...colors,
      },
    }
  }
}
```

```diff:components/SocialIcons.tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { GitHub, Instagram, Linkedin, Twitter } from 'react-feather'

import { constants } from '@utils/constants'

export const SocialIcons: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <>
-     <li className="social-button">
+     <li className="social-button hover:bg-black dark:hover:bg-white dark:hover:text-black">
        <a
          aria-label="Link to Cody Brunner's Github"
          href={constants.externalLinks.github}
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
        >
          <GitHub />
        </a>
      </li>
-     <li className="social-button">
+     <li className="social-button hover:bg-instagram">
        <a
          aria-label="Link to Cody Brunner's Instagram"
          href={constants.externalLinks.instagram}
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
        >
          <Instagram />
        </a>
      </li>
-     <li className="social-button">
+     <li className="social-button hover:bg-linkedIn">
        <a
          aria-label="Link to Cody Brunner's LinkedIn"
          href={constants.externalLinks.linkedin}
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
        >
          <Linkedin />
        </a>
      </li>
-     <li className="social-button">
+     <li className="social-button hover:bg-twitter">
        <a
          aria-label="Link to Cody Brunner's Twitter"
          href={constants.externalLinks.twitter}
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
        >
          <Twitter />
        </a>
      </li>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Extending Tailwind: Custom Animations

Based on the desired effect I wanted and looking at what Tailwind shipped with natively I found I would need to extend the configuration yet again to create a custom animation utility to use. I would need to extend the `keyframes` configuration with the desired effects I wanted and then I could use that custom keyframe in my custom animation.

- [Tailwind Animations](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/animation)

```javascript:tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      animation: {
        // utility: animation-wiggle
        wiggle: 'wiggle 1s ease-in-out infinite',
      },
      keyframes: {
        wiggle: {
          '0% 100%': { transform: 'rotate(-12deg) scale(0.95)' },
          '50%': { transform: 'rotate(12deg) scale(0.95)' },
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Triggering the animation on hover

Tailwind ships with utilities for handling states such as `focus` and `hover`. I could use the `hover:animate-wiggle` utility to trigger the animation when a user mouses over the icon giving the wiggle effect and branded background color.

```diff:components/SocialIcons.tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { GitHub, Instagram, Linkedin, Twitter } from 'react-feather'

import { constants } from '@utils/constants'

export const SocialIcons: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <li className="social-button hover:bg-black dark:hover:bg-white dark:hover:text-black">
        <a
          aria-label="Link to Cody Brunner's Github"
          href={constants.externalLinks.github}
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
        >
-         <GitHub />
+         <GitHub className="hover:animate-wiggle" />
        </a>
      </li>
      <li className="social-button hover:bg-instagram">
        <a
          aria-label="Link to Cody Brunner's Instagram"
          href={constants.externalLinks.instagram}
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
        >
-         <Instagram />
+         <Instagram className="hover:animate-wiggle" />
        </a>
      </li>
      <li className="social-button hover:bg-linkedIn">
        <a
          aria-label="Link to Cody Brunner's LinkedIn"
          href={constants.externalLinks.linkedin}
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
        >
-         <Linkedin />
+         <Linkedin className="hover:animate-wiggle" />
        </a>
      </li>
      <li className="social-button hover:bg-twitter">
        <a
          aria-label="Link to Cody Brunner's Twitter"
          href={constants.externalLinks.twitter}
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          target="_blank"
        >
-         <Twitter />
+         <Twitter className="hover:animate-wiggle" />
        </a>
      </li>
    </>
  )
}
```

And that's it, really was pretty easy to get this setup and I am really impressed with how it turned out. As I stated at the beginning of the article this is not really my cup of tea, but Tailwind made it very simple to get a really cool effect setup in the UI.
