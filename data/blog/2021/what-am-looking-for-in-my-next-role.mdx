title: What I Am Looking For In My Next Role
---

import { Signature } from '../components/MDXComponents.tsx'

My role at [Appointlet](https://appointlet.com) came to an end in April of 2021 and I took some time off to just enjoy my life here in Colombia with my wife. I've been doing the things I want to do and learning the things I want to learn in that time. I did not really actively begin looking for my next role until about mid-July. In the last month and a half of my job search I have learned somethings about living in LATAM as a developer and as a US Citizen. This post is kind of a snapshot in time of what I am looking for and not looking for in my next role.

## What I Am Looking For?

- Remote.
- Frontend Engineer role, with potential for Full-Stack.
- +5/-5 from GMT-5/UTC-5.
- W-2 work **ONLY**, I will not do contract work for tax reasons.
- Relocation to Europe.
- Leadership/Mentorship capabilities
- Access to backend and devops engineers to learn and expand my skills into the backend.
- Small to mid-sized company (15-300 people).
- Work on a close-nit team with a defined workspace and project where I can grow and receive mentorship in areas I am lacking in.
- Flexebility with my hours within reason to company hours.
- Continuing education allowance.
- An Elixir/Phoenix based application would be amazing!

#### Compensation

I have come to find that I will likely not get back to the $78,000 USD per year I was making while at Appointlet if I stay in LATAM. Below is a range I have come up with for the time being. This range is a moving target; however I will not go below the low end of this range. If you are coming in lower than that don't waste my time or yours.

| Low ðŸ“‰     | High ðŸ“ˆ    |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| $25/hr     | $33/hr     |
| $3.800/mo  | $5.300/mo  |
| $50.000/yr | $69.000/yr |

#### Double Taxation

- USA and Colombia have no tax treaty leaving me open to double taxation.
- As long as I am not over $170,000 USD per year I _should not_ have to pay the USA.
- Contract work, 1099-MISC removes my expat tax credits and leaves me paying 24% federal income tax as well as 15% self-employment tax.
- Colombia taxes me at 39%

> I am not paying nearly 70% of my income to two governments, no thanks!

## What I Am Not Looking For?

- Contract Work, 1099-MISC.
- Hours outside of +5/-5 GMT-5/UTC-5
- Relocation to the USA.
- FAANG sized companies.
- Fledgling Startups offering only equity.
- Working more than 40 hours a week.
- Companies/Teams with no defined processes.

## Wrap Up

Money is not necessarily the biggest insentive I am looking for at this point in my life. Am I stupid rich in financial terms, not at all, but money does not bring happiness. I am rich in the company I have in my life. The most important currency to me is my time and I am getting much better at choosing what and who I invest that precious currency into. If you belive I would be a good fit for your team please feel free to reach out and [schedule a time](https://appt.link/cody-brunner-dev) to chat with me about the position using the software I built at Appointlet.
