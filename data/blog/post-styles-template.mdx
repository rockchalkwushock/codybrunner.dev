It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the **readable** content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, `inline code` to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like _readable_ English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors [link](https://cnn.com) use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a **_search_** for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
