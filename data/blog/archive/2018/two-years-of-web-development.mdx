Today marks 2 years since I decided to make the move into web development after leaving my job in robotics. I canâ€™t say I expected to be where I am today which is still gunning for my first full time job in the industry. I decided to make the big move, literally, to Portland, Oregon so I would be in a tech hub instead of continuing to try and find work from Kansas. Itâ€™s been a rough go around thus far in Portland, but I have seen more interest in me as a developer which helps the old ego. Honestly I should have made the move out of Kansas a year ago maybe even to begin with but hindsight is always 20-20.

The last year was full of more mishaps and hardships than anything. Losing my dad. Having a very dear friendship expire. Losing my home to a fire. 2017 really sucked to be honest. There were some good things though.

I wrote my first open source package in [microauth-vkontakte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/microauth-vkontakte):

I landed my first dev role as a freelancer with [BÃ¸thOfUs](http://www.bothofus.se/):

And just a few weeks ago I participated in my first hackathon working on a rebuild of the [High Fives Foundation](https://highfivesfoundation.org/) website using React, GraphQL, and Styled-Components.

I am in the middle of completing a boot camp program through [PDX Code Guild](https://pdxcodeguild.com/) and have been enjoying learning Python (which is so much better than JavaScript, but really what language isnâ€™t better?). Iâ€™ll begin work shortly on my capstone project which will be built using Django and the Fitbit API. Iâ€™m hoping having a boot camp behind me will help out in the job search. I did get the pleasure of sitting down with two recruiters last week for coffee and have good feelings about what they can do to help me out.

I will say I am entering the final push at this. Iâ€™m giving myself until January 01, 2019 to have full time employment as a developer. Should I not be employed or have found gainful employment through contract positions by then I will be hanging up this dream. 2.5 years and no financial results coupled with growing debt just isnâ€™t maintainable. Do I want to move back to Kansas and work whatever job I can find to get by, no, hell no; but there has to be an expiration date on this should it not workout. I can't continue to hope for the best, but until then I will hope for the best and continue to put in the work.
