import { Grid } from '../components/MDXComponents.tsx'

I took the long way around to become a software developer. I have studied engineering, law, & medicine and managed to escape higher education with a Bachelors of Arts in Criminal Justice & Sociology as well as an Associates of Applied Science in Robotics. While in university I competed at the collegiate level in cross country and track & field as well as competing in half and full marathons.

In 2009 I joined the US Navy Reserves to help pay for schooling and one year later deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. I came home another broken and lost soul from the endless wars in the Middle East and suffered many panic attacks and suicide attempts. I would spend the next 6-7 years picking up the pieces from that deployment. I would spend the majority of those years unemployed and suffer from serious bouts of anxiety and depression as well as two more suicide attempts.

In 2016 I decided to walk away from my job as a Robotic Technician and a nearly finished engineering degree to pursue becoming a software developer. For two years I taught myself day and night how to code. In December of 2017 I became homeless due to a fire in my apartment complex. Losing nearly everything I owned and left with very little money in savings I moved to Portland, Oregon in 2018 and used my GI Bill to attend [PDX Code Guild](https://pdxcodeguild.com/). I spent the majority of 2018 living in a homeless shelter, working nights, and attending the Code Guild during the days. In the span of 10 days at the end of August of 2018 all of my hard work and perseverance paid off when I landed my first job in the tech industry at [Appointlet](https://www.appointlet.com/) and found a place to live shortly after.

I lived the next two years in Portland working for Appointlet and enjoying life in the Pacific Northwest. A last minute trip to Miami in June 2019 to meet a friend I had met on the internet years prior would lead to me meeting the love of my life. I began a long distance relationship with her between the USA and Colombia shortly after. On a vacation to Europe in early 2020 I proposed and she said yes. Little did we know a pandemic was just beginning that would keep us apart for the next 6 months. In late October of 2020, as lock down measures lifted I boarded a one way flight to Colombia and shortly after married my best friend.

#### A few fun facts about me:

- I've been to 8 countries and counting.
- Fastest 5k: 16:03.
- Furthest I've ran at one time 53km (33mi).
- I've gone skydiving and loved it!
- I've walked away from a skydiving accident in which my chute failed.

## About this site

My website has had many iterations over the years. It started out as a static site with HTML and CSS hosted on Github. I moved it to NextJS back in the 3.0 days and moved to hosting on Zeit (now Vercel) and later to Gatsby splitting the site and the blog apart. Now I've decided to move back to NextJS with all the feature adds and impressive moves Vercel has made with the framework.

The site is currently written in `next@^11.X` and styled using `tailwindcss@^2.X`. If you feel like taking a look at the source code you can check it out [here](https://github.com/rockchalkwushock/codybrunner.dev).
